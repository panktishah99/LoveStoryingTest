Team members: Brenda Sugey Vega Contreras, Maria Zhou, Pankti Shah

LoveStorying, a cross-platform mobile APP, provides a platform for users to create stories, share stories and discover stories with AI help, focusing on serving the young generation readers (age 3 - 12). It aims to establish a colorful story heaven for the young generation, and to improve their reading habits.

This mobile application is developed using React Native (Javascript) - a  cross platform framework. The debugging and testing was done using Expo client to establish a local server.

The application contains the below basic pages and implemented features-

5. View Story - a scrollable page formatted with the generated story and images for a User friendly reading experience
6. Questionnaire - an evaluation page to answer questions related to the story
